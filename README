====================================

This started as a fork of the YCSB framework:

The LDBC Driver has now diverged a lot from YCSB and will soon be renamed.
It is being developed as part of the Linked Data Benchmark Council EU-funded research project:

The driver is still at an early stage, but to try it out:
---------------

1. Clone and compile LDBC Driver (still called YCSB for now)

	git clone git://github.com/alexaverbuch/YCSB.git
	cd YCSB
	mvn clean package

2. At the moment only one workload is supported, "simpleworkload", which has little configuration options and comprises of only basic key/value operations.
To run it:

	java -cp core/target/core-0.1.jar com.ldbc.driver.Client -db com.ldbc.driver.db.basic.BasicDb -s -P workloads/simpleworkload -t
