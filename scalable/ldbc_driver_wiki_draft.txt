1) What does the driver do?
	Runs a workload
	Collects performance metrics
	Checks validity of results

2) What is a workload?
	Stream of operations
	- Operations are typed
	- Operations have parameters
	- Operations have a scheduled start time (when they are scheduled to be executed)
	- Operations have an expected result: expected format and expected content to be used for validation
	The generated operation stream is well defined (as an extension of the Workload class), and is deterministic and repeatable
	- Workload class defines what workload is generated
	- Driver ships with a number (one at present) of workload implementations, and includes for anyone to define their own workloads
	- More workloads will be added in future
	- Anyone can define and contribute their own workload

3) How does the driver connect to a database?
	Need to extend a number of java classes
	These classes are how the driver communicates with the database
	Basically, you provide the driver with operation handlers, one per operation type in the workload
	The driver calls these handlers to execute each operation in the stream generated by the workload
	- OperationHandler:		- One per operation type
							- Takes Operation as input
							- Returns an OperationResult
	- Db:					- The proxy through which the driver retrieves OperationHandler implementations
							- Responsible for registering OperationHandlers with the driver
							- Used to initialize and clean-up the databse connector, e.g., creating database connections
	- DbConnectionState:	- Optional, does not need to be implemented, but likely necessary
							- Mechanism for OperationHandlers to access managed shared resource that is shared among handlers, e.g., database connection

4) How do I implement a database connector for my database?

5) How do I validate my implementation?

6) How do I run my implementation?

7) Explanation of how to read results?
