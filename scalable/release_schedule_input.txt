 - Read Query Throughput Tuning: 
   we need to know what throughput to set each query type to, i.e., how long we expect them to take (worst case)
   this involves experimentation and measurement.
   to get the desired read/write mix we need to select read query throughputs that fit well with the update throughputs from the data generator
   this involves measurement.
   - measure update throughputs and compare them with read throughputs.
     I am adding code to the driver right now, it is nearly done.
     once that is added the driver will optionally run through the workload and print out the query mix, etc.
     - Responsibility: Alex
     - Time Estimate: 1 day (today)
   - measure run time of each individual read query
     - Responsibility: Mirko
     - Time Estimate: 7? (Ask Mirko for more information. This is in progress but he may need assistance with driver bugs as he runs into them)
 
 - Read Validation
   - create stream containing: Query Type, Parameters, Expected Results
     - Responsibility: Mirko
     - Time Estimate: 1-2 days
   - code changes to driver core to support validation
     - Responsibility: Alex
     - Time Estimate: 1-3 days
   - code changes to SNB workload classes to support validation
     - Responsibility: Alex
     - Time Estimate: 1-2 days

 - Write Validation
   - future work. I think this would be a novel thing and may require a large amount of testing.

 - Vendor Read Query Implementations
   - every vendor should have a driver implemenation for the SNB read workload
   - Time Estimate (Virtuoso): finished?
   - Time Estimate (Neo4j): 1-4 queries need rewriting after workload updates. with correctness testing: 2-3 days
   - Time Estimate (Sparksee): ?

 - Vendor Write Query Implementations
   - every vendor should have a driver implemenation for the SNB write workload
   - Time Estimate (Virtuoso): finished?
   - Time Estimate (Neo4j): 2-4 days with correctness testing
   - Time Estimate (Sparksee): ?

 - Validating Vendor Read Implementations
   once we have the above in place, we can go ahead and check that Virtuoso, Neo4j, and Sparksee all give the same results
   - automated testing using driver
     - Time Estimate : 1 day
   - fixing vendor implementations, fixing possible driver bugs, reaching concensus on expected results
     - Time Estimate: ??? depends greatly on vendors' initial implementations is
